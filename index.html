      <p> There are various type of horseback riding forms. In this
      document, we will explain the various types. The first three
    are English stle of riding while the last one is Western. </p>
      <p> The main difference between English style and Western in that
          English style horses jump, while Western horses do not. Also, the
          riding equipment is a bit different. Within English style, Jumpers and Hunters
          are very similar except for the style of compeition. Drassage horses are
          different in that they don't jump typically.</p>

    <section id="Jumpers" class="main-section">
      <header id="jumpers-header"> Jumpers </header>
      <p> The style of competition is not based on looks but their performance
          in keeping up all the jumps the most quickly. Jumpers is what you usually
          see in the olympics and World Cup. It is also know as
          equestrian showjumping. </p>
      <p> There are various types of horses for this, but the most common are
          warm bloods. The best ones are bred in Europe, so riders in the US often
          go to Europe to try horses and ship them back to the US. </p>

    <section id="Hunters" class="main-section">
      <header id="hunters-header"> Hunters</header>
      <p> This style is similar to jumpers, but the horse and rider are judged by their
          looks and quality of their jumping. The jumps are usually easier to keep up, and
          there isn't a time constraint.</p>
      <p> These horses usually have a calmer temperment. Often times riders want them to move fancy
          and jump cute because that helps them get a better score. </p>

    <section id="Drassage" class="main-section">
      <header id="drassage-header"> Drassage </header>
      <p> This style is usally judged on making the horse move and transition
          well intro trotting and cantering. The riders have exceptional control
          over the movement of the horse. </p>
      <p> These horses are usally a certain type that is bred for this. You will often
          see a black horse with a rider wearing a big black tophat.
